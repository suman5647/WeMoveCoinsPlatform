                        <h5>Ownership of our business</h5>
                        <ul>
                            Wemovecoins.com is owned and operated by WMC Financial Services IVS, Applebys Plads 5, 1411 Copenhagen K, Denmark,
                            (Company registration number/CVR: 37599581).
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Ordering</h5>
                        <ul>
                            By submitting an order, you give us the power to buy bitcoins on your behalf.
                            <br>
                            You accept that we will calculate a quote for you, by the time we accept your payment and have completed your order, and the resulting amount of bitcoins is therefore not guaranteed upon order initiation.
                            <br>
                            We guarantee that all orders will be completed within 24 hours of us receiving your payment, conditioned upon all ID and KYC/AML procedures being adhered to, as stated in our KYC/AML paragraph.
                            <br>
                            A purchase is considered completed when we have made a bitcoin transaction to the bitcoin address stated by you at the time of order initiation.
                            <br>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Price</h5>
                        <ul>
                            The stated price for any order is to be considered not binding, and you agree that the price stated is an estimate price.
                            The final price is subject to the market price at the time of order completion.
                            <br>
                            It is your responsibility to show proper caution at times of high volatility.
                            <br>
                            Our reference price can be found at www.kraken.com/charts under the tab xbt/eur and measured as the selling price shown in the order book for a depth not smaller than 25 BTC.
                            <br>
                            All prices are calculated in EUR, and all other currencies (FIAT) will therefore be converted into EUR at prices and rates at our discretion.
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Commission</h5>
                        <ul>
                            By submitting an order to buy bitcoins, you accept that we charge a commission as clearly stated at the time of your order initiation.
                            <br>
                            This commission is deducted from the amount of FIAT transferred to us.
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Rights of withdrawal</h5>
                        <ul>
                            There is no right of withdrawal on any orders completed on wemovecoins.com, as we cannot revert a completed transaction.
                            We, however, strive to not execute an order, if you as the customer choose to cancel. If you choose to cancel/withdraw an order, please contact us as fast as possible at cancellation@wemovecoins.com. We do not give any guarantees, that we will be able to stop an order after payment is made, but we will do our best.
