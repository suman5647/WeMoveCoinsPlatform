                        <h5>Ownership of our business</h5>
                        <ul>
                            Monni.com is owned and operated by Monni ApS, Nørrebrogade 47, 1., 2200 Copenhagen N, Danmark (CVR: 39653699).
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Ordering</h5>
                        <ul>
                            By submitting an order to buy an offered cryptocurrency, you give us the power to buy such on your behalf.
                            <br/>
                            You accept that we will calculate a quote for you, by the time we receive your payment and have completed your order, and the resulting amount of cryptocurrencies is therefore not guaranteed upon order initiation.
                            <br/>
                            By submitting an order to sell one of our accepted cryptocurrencies, you give us the power to sell such on your behalf. You accept that we will calculate a quote for you, by the time we receive your transaction, to the payment address specified, and that the resulting FIAT amount is therefore not guaranteed upon order initiation. For Bitcoin and Ether transfers, we will quote your order at 0-confirmations, while only initiate payout after 6-confirmations for Bitcoin and 30-confirmations for Ether. For larger amounts, we may delay quotation at our discression.
                            <br/>
                            We guarantee that all orders will be completed within 12 hours of us receiving your payment, conditioned upon all ID and KYC/AML procedures being adhered to, as stated in our KYC/AML paragraph. For sell orders, you further accept, that if an order is rejected or cancelled after you have send us any cryptocurrency funds, then since the exchange happens at 0-confirmations, you will only be entitled to the resulting FIAT amount and NOT to get the cryptocurrencies you sent us, back. Our compliance and support team will then help you find a solution to either get funds payout in FIAT or to exchange your due amount back into cryptocurrecies, where you might incur additional fees.
                            <br/>
                            A purchase is considered completed when we have made a cryoptocurrency transaction to the cryptocurrency address stated by you at the time of order initiation. A sale is considered completed once we have instructed our bank, PSP, payment or wallet provider, to perform a transfer of your proceeds to the destination you stated during order initiation.
                            <br/>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Price</h5>
                        <ul>
                            The stated price for any order is to be considered not binding, and you agree that the price stated is an estimate price. The final price is subject to the market price at the time of order completion or in case of a sell order, at the time we receive or process your transaction.
                            <br />
                            It is your responsibility to show proper caution at times of high volatility.
                            <br />
                            Our reference price can be found at www.kraken.com/charts under the tab xbt/eur or eth/eur and measured as the Bid or Ask price shown in the order book for a depth not smaller than 25 BTC.
                            <br />
                            All prices are calculated in EUR, and all other currencies (FIAT) will therefore be converted into EUR at prices and rates at our discretion.
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Commission</h5>
                        <ul>
                            By submitting an order to buy or sell a cryptocurrency, you accept that we charge a commission as clearly stated at the time of your order initiation. You also accept that we may charge a transfer fee, dependent on your means of payout, as clearly stated at the time of order intitiation.
                            <br />
                            This commission is deducted from the amount of FIAT or cryptocurrency transferred to us.
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Rights of withdrawal</h5>
